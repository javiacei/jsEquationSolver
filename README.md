# Javascript Equation Solver

This application resolve linear equations through three different methods: Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and Successive over-relaxation.

# Installation

To install this application you only need to download this code and run the index.html file on any web browser (I have not tested in IE).

NOTE: To run this application you need a machine with an Internet connection because I used a remote library.

# How is it used?

This application resolve these equations: Ax = B. When you run index.html file, you can edit matrix A and vector B with the desired values.

For example, If you write:

A = [ 
  [-4, 2],
  [-8, 4]
]

B = [-100, -200]

This is the same that: Ax = B --> -4x + 2y = -100 and -8x + 4y = -200;

Also you can edit Error Tolerance, Initial Vector and Maximum Number of Iterations.
